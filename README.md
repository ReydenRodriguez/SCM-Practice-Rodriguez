Software configuration management (SCM) is a set of activities that have been developed to manage change throughout the life cycle of computer software.  It involves version control, change management, and build automation.  The SCM Repository is a set of mechanisms and data structures that allow a software team to manage change in an effective mannger.  GitHub helps with SCM by providing a cloud-based platform for version control using Git, enabling collaboration, branch management, and history tracking. Developers can track changes, merge updates, and resolve conflicts efficiently. This ensures organized software development, reducing errors and improving team coordination.
